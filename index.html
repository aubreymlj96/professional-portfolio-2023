                    Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Aubrey Johnson and I am enrolled in a coding boot camp at the University of Denver. 
                    After I graduated college, I started my professional career as a Client Success analyst in financial services, providing
                    application support for equity and wealth management bookbuilding applications to sell side banks. Fast forward 2 years and I 
                    transitioned to a product consultant role, where I manage client relationships relative to the applications. As a product consultant 
                    in the financial services industry, I manage client relationships
                    while working parallel with developers/product designers. I am hoping to obtain new skills
                    in this course, which will hopefully further my career path and open doors as I look towards
                    other career paths. At present, my portfolio consists of a pre-work study guide and a marketing Agency
                    webpage that consists of both HTML and CSS languages. As I progress in the boot camp, I am aiming to include 
                    more projects in my portfolio. Please see the respective sections below for links to the projects.
